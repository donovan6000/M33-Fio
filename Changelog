V0.24.2 January 11, 2016

	* Fixed an issue where the printer would occasionally not send back confirmations for processed commands

V0.24.1 January 11, 2016

	* Fixed printing G-code files that are longer than 65535 lines

V0.24 January 10, 2016

V0.23 December 17, 2015

	* Implemented way to modify the printer profile, slicer profile, and model when slicing
	* Improved the on the fly pre-procesor so that it doesn't send so many G4 commands. Thanks mrvn!
	* Went through all the pre-processor stages and made sure they match the ones in the official software. The only stages that differ are preparation, thermal bonding and wave bonding since the official versions have errors or lacks functionality.

V0.20 November 25, 2015

	* Added EEPROM management
	* Changed way that messages are shown so that they look more native to OctoPrint
